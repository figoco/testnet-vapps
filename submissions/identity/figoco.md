## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: IDVault
- **Category**: identity

### Description
IDVault is a decentralized identity management platform that allows users to securely create, verify, and manage digital identities.
It reduces the risk of identity theft and fraudulent accounts while giving users control over their personal information.

### SL Integration  
IDVault uses Soundness Layer (SL) to verify identities and credential claims via zk-proofs.
SL ensures that identity verifications are secure, privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof.

## Technical

### Architecture
IDVault uses a React-based frontend that allows users to intuitively register and manage their digital identities. The backend runs on Node.js, handling credential verification and zk-proof requests to the Soundness Layer (SL). Verified identity data is stored on the blockchain via SL and the Ethereum testnet, while user metadata and credentials are stored in a decentralized manner on IPFS.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js 
- **Blockchain**: SL + Ethereum testnet
- **Storage**: IPFS
